This project contains multiple scripts used to run MaxEnt inversions of NR data. It also contains 
the subsequent data analysis scripts used to analyse MaxEnt data as well as MDPD data for comparison.

For indepth descriptions please see the relevant README files in each folder.

All c++ files come with the makefile required to generate the working executable file.

MaxEnt - The script used to run one-component MaxEnt inversions

MultiComponentSystem - The script used to run multicomponent MaxEnt inversions using algorithm I. 
This version of the script removes the 1/q^4 dependence and is best suited to working with simulated data.

MultiComponentSystemNoCons - The script used to run multicomponent MaxEnt inversions using algorithm II. 
This version of the script removes the 1/q^4 dependence and is best suited to working with simulated data.

MultiComponentSystemReal - The script used to run multicomponent MaxEnt inversions using algorithm I. 
This version of the script does not remove the 1/q^4 dependence and is best suited to working with real data.

MultiComponentSystemNoConsReal - The script used to run multicomponent MaxEnt inversions using algorithm II. 
This version of the script does not remove the 1/q^4 dependence and is best suited to working with real data.

BASH - contains a simple BASH script used to run multiple iterations of the MaxEnt inversions. This was used
to perform parametric testing.

DataAnalysis - This script is used to average over multiple runs so that analysis at a given parametric 
configuration can be performed.

MDPDAnalysis/SLDCalc - A python script used to convert MDPD bead density profiles into an SLD profiles.
It also averages over steps to provide a reasonable comparison with MaxEnt data.

MDPDAnalysis/MaxEntMDPDComp - A script to rescale the MDPD profiles from SLDCalc so they can be compared 
against MaxEnt data.
